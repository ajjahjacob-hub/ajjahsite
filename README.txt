File to add general notes on the project

To add a new image to any place in the project, use the following line:
<img src="images/NameOFYourImage.something" width="600" height="400" alt="Add a short description here">
Thanks  Jacob
On the gallery page is there any chance you can create that page as a link page to folders.
So for example when you click on the Co-Housing picture it then links you to the content of that project portfolio? If you dont understand I'll chat with you.
Total subpages: 5 minimum
TODO: Fix margin issues with gallery/project page figures
TODO: Fix gallery images not aligning with figure outline
TODO: Fix footer width
TODO: Consider changing gallery page to "Projects" page
TODO: Verify alignment and text consistency across pages
TODO: Consider adding a dedicated back button to each of the project subpages. Alternatively,
a seperate, vertical navigation menu on the left for the different projects.
TODO: Add organised subfolders for images based on the webpage/category the belong to
TODO: Potentially increase font size/bold for the name/heading of each project

Just noticed the formatting issues on gallery pages after update, should be an easy fix (only apparent on some screen sizes)

TODO: Add view fullscreen/larger when clicking project images
