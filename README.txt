To add a new image to any place in the project, use the following line:
<img src="images/NameOFYourImage.something" width="600" height="400" alt="Add a short description here">

On the gallery page is there any chance you can create that page as a link page to folders.  So for example when you click on the Co-Housing picture it then links you to the content of that project portfolio?  If you dont understand I'll chat with you.
